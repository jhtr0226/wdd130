    <h2>Johann Tellez</h2>
    <p>Hey there folks! I'm Johann and I'm 22, I like learning, helping and studying!
        I am not married yet, who know maybe I will in some years... 
        I work in a pharmacy which is sick! I learn about meds and their side-effects,
        but I have to make people use the pharmacy, which I kind of don't like
        because I first help them (I love that part) and then I enroll them to the pharmacy
        and I don't like it beacause I feel I use their emotions to get
        my sell... But that is how life is!! It goes me pretty well at selling as long as I start the day with a prayer.    
    </p>
    <p>I'm from Costa Rica, so if you want to come for vacations you know you can call
        me and so I'll be your touristic guide, no charge of course!
        I served a mission in the States, in Gilbert, back in 2020, it was a crazy time to serve!
        But the Lord blessed me with the gift of tongues so now I can speak English!
        I'm a short guy of words, sorry about that but if you ask anything I'll be more than glad to
        respond your questions... So far I just want to say, take care! Bye!
    </p>
