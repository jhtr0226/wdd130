Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People who want a website will want to explore options and when they find me, they will find quality. The first thing they will see will be the home page, as many other home pages, that are easy to use or read, this one will not only be easy to read and use but it will let you know about my purpose here for you, the page will show why is it call CosmoWebs and it will explain what I want you to achieve as long as you give me the chance to help. This home page will contain around four “sections” The first 3 will go next to each other because it does not matter the order of how you read them, they just explain: first, my purpose, second, what can you expect from this page and the third one is just a “square or section” that indicates what each of them are (like pointers to the other last two), then, in the bottom there is going to be a section just giving some “examples” of what kind of websites I can help you to create (there are not going to be designs but pictures of the topic, like a picture of a gym for example, I want to work about those examples of other websites but that is an extra I will take later) with a bottom in the middle that goes to the third page “Get a Website” (which is a kind of like “contact us”) and then the footer with the links to go to the other child pages and with the links to explore my social media, so if they want, they can also contact me there, maybe I should create a profile for CosmoWebs instead of putting my own profiles– This page design will have a simple design about outer space.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        The second page is going to be something about me, since I am selling myself, I felt it would be important or a good idea to introduce myself to the public, so this page will be dedicated to let you know who I am and about my terms and conditions to get you a website, I would say I will share a little about my morals and what I will keep doing for you even after the website is created for you. 
	This page will have a picture of myself to “meet them face to face” – This page will have a simple design about outer space too, but I will be looking forward to maybe change it for one who design will be of the same theme but different, so every page will be different. There is also a picture of an alien looking at a pc, to let you know your website will reach other galaxies metaphorically.

      </ul>
      <h3>Get a Website!</h3>
      <p>
        The third page is the “Get a website” which is a kind of Contact us, I will have a little “formulary” that most probably will not be possible to be filled because I have no idea of how to make it work, but I will find that out later for sure. 
	People will want to come to this part to request a website, it will ask for email address, name of the person who is requesting the website and it will have a space to describe and give details about the website that you want. 
	It will also have some frequently asked questions (FAQ) section, with just a couple questions… maybe three or two, this section must be before the one where you request to be contacted, it will also state at the end that the price will be negotiable but not less than fifteen dollars per page– This page will have the same design about outer space as well, but same thing here, I hope I might find a design of the same theme but something different to give “style”. One of the pictures is to be next to the contact us part and the other will be for the faq part.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        That image from the middle is a gif of a shooting star, I would love to make it work there so it won't look empty. The other 2 squares without title are audince and a link to get to know me (I might add images there too), last part are just ideas or examples of cases that I can work on for you
      </p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        I think this is a simple one and it won't suffer any changes from what we see

      <h3>Get a Website</h3>
      <p>         
        I would love to add another picture there but I haven't pick another one (PD: All the pages are going to have the same background (stars))
